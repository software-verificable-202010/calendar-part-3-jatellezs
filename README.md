Use arrow keys to move between months and weeks.  
Use space bar to change between Month View and Week View.  
While in Week View, use Enter Key to Create an Appointment.  
In My Appointments you can update or delete the selected appointment and add or remove users.  
To see changes reflected in your calendar, just change views and go back to the desired one (sorry about that).  
  
There is currently 1 warning and 13 messages in the project.  
I left the warning (Marcar ensamblados con NeutralResponseLanguageAttribute), because it references a file that is outside of the project and this warning does not affect negatively my project because i am using CultureInfo method to deal with this inside my solution.  
The 13 warnings are about making variables readonly, which are Lists that i want to alter, so making them readonly is contraproducent so i leave them as it is.
