Use arrow keys to move between months and weeks.  
Use space bar to change between Month View and Week View.  
While in Week View, use Enter Key to Create an Appointment.  
In My Appointments you can update or delete the selected appointment and add or remove users.  
To see changes reflected in your calendar, just change views and go back to the desired one (sorry about that).
